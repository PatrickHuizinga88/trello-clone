# Trello Clone

**Demo: https://patrickhuizinga88.github.io/trello-clone/**

My third public project in Vue.

This project is a simplified version of the planning webapplication Trello. In this application you can add lists and add, edit and view tasks. You can also change the position of both lists and tasks.

This was made with the help of a Vue Mastery's intermediate course. I've also added some customization myself.
